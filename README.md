Lottery games are different from other gambling games because these games doesnâ€™t depend upon the skill of the player but is completely depended upon the luckiness. There is an urgent need for replacement of traditional system by a totally computerised system that ensure fairness,transparency and the fair distribution of funds, which all are the most common problems that most people surmise, distrust, and complain about .And due to these facts we bestrew Blockchain with the process of purchasing and selling of lotteries. We use blockchain technology in evaluating payment, ticketing and payouts in distribution environments.Blockchain network allows equal participation of each player. There is no central power concept instead power is distributed among all participants.
